## Client Deployment

In this workshop, the client is an HTML5 application exported from the Godot Engine. It runs in a web browser and does not require any client-side development.

You just need to configure the APIGateway URL deployed by SAM in the previous steps.

Please note that the client application is not the focus of this workshop, and it is for demonstration purposes only. It may have bugs, so your feedback is welcome.

The game client in this workshop is developed from a great open source project [Circle_Jump](https://github.com/kidscancode/circle_jump)
